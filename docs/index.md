# Ensemble

**Multi-agent collaboration engine** — AI agents that work as one.

Ensemble orchestrates AI agents into collaborative teams. Out of the box it pairs **Claude Code + Codex** — they communicate, share findings, and solve problems together in real time.

> **Status:** Experimental developer tool. Not a production framework (yet).
>
> **Default team:** Claude Code (lead) + Codex (worker). You can [add other agents](configuration#supported-agents) like Gemini (experimental) or any custom CLI tool.

## What does it do?

You give a task. Ensemble spawns a team of AI agents, each in their own tmux session, that **talk to each other** to solve it. You watch the conversation unfold in real time via a TUI monitor or inline feed.

```
You: "Review the auth module for security issues"

  codex-1: I'll audit the config, entitlements, and privacy settings.
  claude-2: Got it. I'll focus on the Swift code — crash risks, dead code, performance.
  codex-1: Found hardcoded API key in NetworkService.swift line 42...
  claude-2: Confirmed. Also found unvalidated user input in AuthHandler.swift...
```

## Use with Claude Code

Ensemble ships with a `/collab` skill for [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code). Just type:

```
/collab "Review the auth module for security issues"
```

Claude spawns a team, shows the agent conversation live, and presents results when they're done. Setup in one command:

```bash
./scripts/setup-claude-code.sh
```

See [Configuration → Claude Code integration](configuration#claude-code-integration) for details.
